# About the website
### Our website C.E.R Auto is a image editing website where you can CUT/CROP, EDIT and RESIZE your image with ease, without the need to download other apps or look at overly complicated buttons.

# Prototype description 
The current prototype have a working edit page, start page where you can select which tool you would like to use either cut, edit or resize but we do not have a working cut or resize page because there was some issues and the file was missing when I(kenneth) reopened his laptop to submit the work, the homepage is responsive and working properly but the about us section is filled with lorem ipsum since we are not sure of how we should feel it and in the github version there are a view errors I’m not sure what’s wrong with the github version but some of the image we originally place was missing in the github live website version, all existing working page have a working flex screen/box. However, another issue I previously overlooked in the editing page it’s that it can only be saved as a file called “Image.jpeg” as that is how the code is structured in the javascript code.

# Website features :shipit:

#### - 🖌️Edit page: Where you can adjust your image Saturation, Brightness, Grayscale, Inversion values and also flip and rotate your image.

# Why we choose to make this? 😕
Well because a Lot of artists nowadays use the internet to find references and also use pictures they took on their phone/camera and save it digitally for reference, but sometimes or most of the time the reference is just not the right size for the paper, canvas or other mediums of drawing. I'm sure some skilled artists out there will just either resize or edit it to their liking and imagination, but some are not as skilled as them and end up with drawings that have weird proportions and wrong measurements. Then again some people might choose to try and digitally crop, resize and edit the image, but yet again some are not as skilled or technologically fluent to do that properly or with ease.

And so we thought why not give them an easier solution, a solution where you just need to have two things and that is the size of your drawing media and your picture. With these two inputs, it can take the proportion of the drawing media and help crop, edit and resize the image what is desired.
