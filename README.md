# Prototype description
The current prototype have a working edit page, start page where you can select which tool you would like to use either cut, edit or resize but we do not have a working cut or resize page because there was some issues and the file was missing when I(kenneth) reopened his laptop to submit the work, the homepage is responsive and working properly but the about us section is filled with lorem ipsum since we are not sure of how we should feel it and in the github version there are a view errors I’m not sure what’s wrong with the github version but some of the image we originally place was missing in the github live website version, all existing working page have a working flex screen/box. However, another issue I previously overlooked in the editing page it’s that it can only be saved as a file called “Image.png” as that is how I input it in the javascript code.

# Additional Note
 Some of the Javascript is learned through Youtube Videos
